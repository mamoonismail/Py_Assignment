# Py_Assignment

### The repository encompases the following

1- seq_complexity.py script which designated to read fasta files to count the observed and possible kemrs, the results will be as data 
fram for each species in (csv format) and (png format)

2- Data folder where the output of kemrs count will be stored for each species 

3- Plots folder where the plots of linguistic complexity and sum of observed and possible kmers

4- fasta file used in this assignment

5- test_seq_Complexity to test the script before excuting

### How to run the script and test

1- Run the script through terminal (ANACONDA) type: python seq_Complexity.py nd2.fasta

2- Run the test through terminal (ANACONDA) type: pytest seq_Complexity.py
